Its much awaited movie of Kamal Hassan's biggest-ever film, which has been delayed for one or the other reason, has seen the light of day in foreign countries but not in Tamil Nadu and other Southern states as the High Court has stayed the release after several Muslim groups raised objection. After a gap of three years, Kamal Hassan is back with Viswaroopam, which is written, directed and produced by himself. The film was supposed to be directed by Selvaraghavan but as the director walked out of the film due to other commitments, Kamal took the responsibility of directing the film. The film is simultaneously made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. It is made with the budget of Rs 95 crore, which is the second highest budget Tamil film after Rajinikanth's blockbuster Endhiran. What does the multilingual action-thriller has to offer? A reader named Praveen Kumar from New Jersey reviewed the film, as the movie was not released here. Read on for the review.The movie starts in America. Viswanath (Kamal Hassan), who will be seen as Kathak trainer, is surrounded by girls and one among them is Andrea Jeremiah. This makes Dr Nirupama (Pooja Kumar) to doubt on her hubby's character and hires a detective, who gets killed by Al-Qaeda group. The Al-Qaeda is planning to plant a Nuclear Bomb in New York and Kamal Hassan is well-aware of it. How? He has a past where he has a connection with the terrorist group, which is headed by Omar (Rahul Bose). Will the terrorist organisation succeed in their mission? What role does Kamal play? Is he a terrorist or an undercover agent? To know all these, you should watch the film. The story of the film begins on a slow note but it is gripping. The first half is entirely shot in the US, and keeps you engaged and generate a lot of curiosity. When it comes to second half, the narration is dragging at parts but gets interesting with Kamal Hassan's past getting revealed.Viswaroopam has a wonderful story. It is well-backed by technical aspects like action and cinematography. It has to be noted that only one song will be part of the film even though the album of the film has a couple of tracks. Kamal ends on the note that Viswaroopam will continue until Omar or he is killed.",3.75,action,2013,kamalhaasan  poojakumar,kamalhaasan,kamalhaasan  poojakumar  rahulbose  andreajeremiah  samratchakrabarti  leewhittaker  loymendonsa,kamalhaasan  prasadvpotluri  shankarmahadevan  ehsaannoorani,viswaroopam dub version tamil movi viswaroopam much await movi kamal hassan film delay one reason seen light day foreign countri tamil nadu southern state high court stay releas sever muslim group rais object gap three year kamal hassan back viswaroopam written direct produc film suppos direct selvaraghavan director walk film due commit kamal took respons direct film film simultan made tamil telugu hindi made budget crore second highest budget tamil film rajinikanth blockbust endhiran multilingu offer reader name praveen kumar new jersey review film movi releas read review movi start america viswanath kamal hassan seen kathak trainer surround girl one among andrea jeremiah make nirupama pooja kumar doubt hubbi charact hire detect get kill group plan plant nuclear bomb new york kamal hassan past connect terrorist group head omar rahul bose terrorist organis succeed mission role kamal play terrorist undercov agent know watch film stori film begin slow note grip first half entir shot keep engag gener lot curios come second half narrat drag part get interest kamal hassan past get reveal viswaroopam wonder stori technic aspect like action cinematographi note one song part film even though album film coupl track kamal end note viswaroopam continu omar kill

Director Srikanth Addala and producer Dil Raju have done it and dared to bring two superstars (Mahesh Babu and Venkatesh) together on screen with Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (SVSC), which has hit the marquee today. The much-hyped movie, which had created huge expectations among the film goers, is really a wonderful flick that suits the image of the superstars and it is a big treat for their fans this Sankranthi. Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu is a complete family drama with a few commercial elements. The performances of Mahesh Babu and Venkatesh are the main attractions in the film. Srikanth Addala's brilliant narration and dialogues, Mickey J Meyer's melodious music, KV Guhan's beautiful picturisation are its other highlights. What the film lacks is the absence of lead actors' heroism and slow-paced narration in the second half. The movie narrates a simple and beautiful story, which revolves around a middle class family. The movie is all about brother sentiment. With his brilliant storytelling, Srikanth Addala has brought out the emotions between various characters in the family in a realistic way. The first half of the film is very interesting with few heart touching moments and songs. The second half is also good, but it falls short to catch up fast with the pace of the narration. Relangi Mavayya (Prakash Raj) is a gentleman from a small village Relangi and he believes in human values and relationships. He has two sons Peddodu aka Mallikharjuna Rao (Venkatesh) and Chinnodu aka Seetha Rama Raju (Mahesh Babu). Peddodu is an emotional guy and his maradalu Seetha (Anjali) is in love with him since her childhood. Whereas Mahesh Babu is a witty and charming young man and he falls in love with Geetha (Samantha), the daughter of Rao Ramesh. But Rao Ramesh ridicules Prakash Raj for his low wealth and this strains the relationships between both brothers.

The rustic voice introduces us to the two warring kingdoms of Kalingpura and Kottaipattanam to the south of the country. It’s after one of the many bloody battles between the two dynasties that we see a little boy running away from his brother, with blood smeared on his face. The citizens of the kingdom ruled by the senior Rajinikanth have nothing to worry in life and are enjoying all the pleasures under the sun. The king now becomes a victim of a plot hatched by one of his own men (Jackie Shroff), who plays the kingpin in the plot. Then Comes Rana, who impresses us and the king of Kalingpura with his gallantry. He goes on to win many battles for Kalingpura and gains the trust of King Mahendra Raj (Jacckie Sharoff) and his son Veera Bhadra. He then convinces them to wage a war on Kottaipattanam, using the men they had captured from that kingdom. It’s only on the battlefield that Rana announces his solidarity to Kottaipattanam. While King Rishikodayan (Nassar) embraces Rana, the prince rewards his friend and his heroism with the title of the ‘commander in chief’.

Although we have seen many PLR stories in the past, 'Manam' is special. A complete entertainer that is more than a love story.""]","Manam is an romantic comedy entertainer movie directed by Vikram Kumar. The film stars the late Nageswara Rao, Nagarjuna and Naga Chaitanya along with Shriya Saran and Samantha. Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan done a Special appearance in this movie. StoryEntire movie deals from the year 1920 to 2013 and this is the last movie of Nageswara Rao. 'Manam' is a story filled with joy and rejoicing in reuniting with the lost ones.Watch out for that similarities in the behaviour of the two Nagarjunas. When he is wooing his beloved one, one time as a man still a child at heart and the second time as a rich bachelor savouring his moments with his chosen girl, he self-forgetfully loses his social identity to become an individual showing nothing but unconditional love.It's not wise to compare the performance of Nag and the legendary actor, Late ANR, but somehow the film seems like a Nag film. That fabulous scene in which he expresses a pleasant surprise at having seen his 'father' inside the plane. That fabulous scene in which he becomes nervous when he finds his 'mother', not knowing that he is holding in his hands a book by name 'The world's greatest mom'. ANR is seen in a one-of-its-kind role. He is full of josh and, like Nag, exudes that child-like rapture at seeing his beloved ones. On the flip side, his role is shorter than one would have expected.Naga Chaitanya is relatively seen in more number of scenes and he does that rom-com act and everything with ease. He strikes a good chemistry with Samantha, yet again. Samantha, too, has got many scenes and she gets her emotional act right.  But it is her scenes with Nag which are truly fun to watch; she is such a natural in her scenes with Nag. Shreya proves her mettle yet again. Watch her when she says to Nag about impending marriage with some important person who found her lovable.ANR saying to Chai, ""Prathi vadu tagi Devadas antadu,"" is such a treat to watch. Yes, ANR takes pride in boozing here!All the main characters have a meaningful place in the story. The climax gives that surreal feel.Anoop Rubens scored music, while Harshavardan written dialogues for this movie.  MarketingThe first look poster of the film was released on September 19, 2013, on the eve of Akkineni Nageswara Rao's 90th birthday.

It is a remake of Aashiq Abu's Malayalam film Salt N' Pepper. It is a romantic story between two couples who accidentally get to know each other through their common love for food. Story Kalidasu (Prakash Raj) works in the state archaeological department and is a food lover. His only companion is his cook, Servant (Brahmaji). Naveen (Tejus) is Kalidasu's nephew who comes to stay with him, while looking for a job. Kalidasu has a normal life until he gets a mis-dialled phone call from Gowri (Sneha), a dubbing artiste living with her friend Meghna (Samyuktha). Gowri rings to order a special Dosa from a restaurant, but gets Kalidasu instead. Their conversations do not go well at first, but a long-distance romance develops due to their common interest—cooking and food. Kalidasu is a born gourmet while Gowri is indulging in culinary activities in memory of her dead mother. Kalidasu starts to let Gowri into the secrets of baking with a multi-layered cake called ""Joan's Rainbow"". Kalidasu and Gowri both get the jitters before their first face-to-face meeting, as each becomes conscious of their own physical appearances, and both decide to send younger and better looking substitutes instead, Naveen and Meghna. When they meet, neither Naveen nor Meghna realise that the other person is a substitute, since they introduce themselves as Kalidasu and Gowri respectively. Naveen thinks that Kalidasu is actually in love with Meghna, while Meghna thinks that Gowri is in love with Naveen. They attempt to sabotage their older counterpart's relationship by telling Kalidasu and Gowri respectively that the person they met would be unsuitable for them. Kalidasu and Gowri try to forget each other, but fail, and they decide to call each other and meet anyway. Naveen and Meghna, who by this time had started to develop feelings for each other, are dejected upon hearing this and decide to leave the city so that their older counterpart may have a good relationship.

Later, he is raised by a tribe on the hills.After growing up into a handsome young man, Shivudu gets attracted to Avantika (Tamanna). Well, who is this Avantika?

Shivudu who falls in love with Avantika takes the responsibility of saving Devasena. He travels to the kingdom where Devasena is being slaved and tortured.To his surprise, the moment people notice him in that kingdom, they call him 'Bahubali'.

A daughter of a poor farmer, who happens to be a cricket fanatic, Kausalya (Aishwarya Rajesh) fantasizes the sport while she lags behind with her academics. She has to deal with a typical mother but a super supportive father in order to realize her dreams. She hails from a tiny village where pursuing dreams by female is considered as a sin.Krishnamurthy (Rajendra Prasad) is shown as a huge cricket follower when he stands as strong as a rock when his father passes away but breaks down when India loses a match. He is a practical thinker and also, stands by the side of his daughter no matter what. He goes easy on his daughter's academics while he tries everything to make her daughter a successful cricketing professional. We will be introduced to Sivakarthikeyan, a cricket coach who is subtle, sensible and gentle. Unlike the typical Siva, we see a matured and professional actor in the form of coach. The bonding between Krishnamurthy and Kausalya are shot in a convincing manner which makes daughters crave for a father like krishnamurthy.

His life takes a steep turn after a ruthless killer Vishnu (Nani) challenges him and his capability as a police officer. One after the other, the killer takes the lives of several people starting from Adithya's colleague Prasad. The former leaves certain clues and riddles on the foreheads of the dead to make the hide and seek game between the duo interesting. Apoorva Ramanujam (Nivetha Thomas), a wannabe writer and also a fan (later becomes girlfriend) of Adithya helps him solve a few puzzles of the merciless killer.
